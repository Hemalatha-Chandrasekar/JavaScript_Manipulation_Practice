# Javascript-Manipulation-Practice

## Overview

This is a practice project aimed at improving your skills in working with JavaScript arrays, objects, and arrays of objects. It includes various exercises that focus on manipulating arrays and objects using JavaScript methods.

## Project Breakdown

### Ticket 1: Basic Array Methods
- **Add a new employee to the end of the array:**  
  Use the `push()` method to add an element to the end of the array.
- **Remove the last employee from the array:**  
  Use the `pop()` method to remove the last element from the array.
- **Add a new employee to the beginning of the array:**  
  Use the `unshift()` method to add an element to the beginning of the array.
- **Remove the first employee from the array:**  
  Use the `shift()` method to remove the first element from the array.
- **Find the index of 'Sarah' in the array:**  
  Use the `indexOf()` method to find the index of a specific element in the array.

### Ticket 2: Intermediate Array Methods
- **Filter out salaries below $50,000:**  
  Use the `filter()` method to remove elements based on a condition.
- **Create a new array with the square of each salary:**  
  Use the `map()` method to transform each element in the array.
- **Find the first salary greater than $60,000:**  
  Use the `find()` method to return the first element that satisfies a condition.
- **Calculate the total sum of all sales made:**  
  Use the `reduce()` method to sum all elements in the array.
- **Loop through the list of departments:**  
  Use the `forEach()` method to iterate through the array.

### Ticket 3: Advanced Array Manipulation
- **Create a new array containing the first three items from the inventory list:**  
  Use the `slice()` method to extract a portion of the array.
- **Remove two items starting from index 2 in the inventory:**  
  Use the `splice()` method to remove elements from the array.
- **Add new equipment to the inventory starting at index 3:**  
  Use the `splice()` method to add elements at a specific index.
- **Merge two arrays of office equipment into one:**  
  Use the `concat()` method to merge two arrays.
- **Sort the sales list in descending order:**  
  Use the `sort()` method with a comparison function to sort the array in descending order.

### Ticket 4: Working with Objects
- **Create an employee object with properties:** `firstName`, `lastName`, `position`, and `salary`.
- **Update the position of the employee object.**
- **Add a new property (`hireDate`) to the employee object.**
- **Delete the `salary` property from the employee object.**
- **Loop through the properties of the employee object:**  
  Use a `for...in` loop to iterate over the object's properties.

### Ticket 5: Combining Arrays and Objects
- **Create an array of objects representing projects with properties:** `projectName`, `deadline`, and `status`.
- **Create a new array containing only the project names.**
- **Filter the array to only include projects that are 'in progress'.**
- **Sort the projects by their deadline in ascending order.**
